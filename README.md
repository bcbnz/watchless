watchless
=========

*Latest release: version 0.2.0 - 12 July 2013*

watchless is a Python clone of the standard Unix ``watch`` command with the
addition of paging support along the lines of another standard Unix command,
``less``.

Requirements
============

* Python 2.4 or greater with the curses module available (should be present on
  Unix-based systems; Windows has no support by default, although some Cygwin
  builds *may* have it and there are third-party libraries claim to implement
  it -- your mileage may vary).

Usage
=====

``./watchless.py [options] <command>``

Options
-------

* ``-v``, ``--version`` - show program's version number and exit
* ``-h``, ``--help`` - show a help message and exit
* ``-n <seconds>``, ``--interval=<seconds>`` - time to wait between updates [default: 2.0s]
* ``-p``, ``--precise`` - rather than waiting *interval* seconds between one
  run finishing and the next starting, try to time it so there are *interval*
  seconds between each run starting. If the command takes longer than
  *interval* seconds to run, then it will be run as often as possible.
* ``-d``, ``--differences`` - highlight the differences in the output of
  sequential runs of the command. If you want to highlight all the positions
  that have ever changed (i.e., a 'sticky' highlight), use
  ``--differences=cumulative``. Note you cannot use ``-d cumulative`` as this
  leads to an ambiguity (is ``cumulative`` an argument or the command to
  execute?) since the argument is optional.
* ``-c``, ``--color`` - interpret ANSI foreground colour sequences in the output.
* ``-b``, ``--beep`` - beep if the command exits with a non-zero return code.
* ``-e``, ``--errexit`` - exit if the command exits with a non-zero return code.
* ``-t``, ``--no-title`` - do not show the header with the command and last execution time.
* ``-r``, ``--no-return-code`` - do not show the last return code in the header at
  the top of the screen.
