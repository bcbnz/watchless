        """The standard Python subprocess module is used to execute the command.
        This can either do so within the current process (``shell=False``) or
        using an external shell (``shell=True``). In general, ``shell=False`` is
        preferred except when the command contains special shell characters
        (e.g., the globbing character '*') which needs to be run in a shell to
        work properly. In this case, it usually has to be escaped when entering
        it and so the command passed in is a single-entry list.

        If the ``shell`` parameter is ``None``, the class will try to guess the
        appropriate setting using the following two steps:

            1. If the command list has more than one item, assume the command
               was not escaped when entered and therefore has no special
               characters; set ``shell`` to ``False``. Otherwise go to 2.
            2. If the single entry has any special characters (the list of which
               is defined in the module-level variable ``shell_chars``), then
               set ``shell`` to ``True``. Otherwise set it to ``False``.

        :param command: The command to run as a list of one or more strings.
        :param interval: The interval, in seconds, between execution.
        :param shell: Whether to spawn an external shell to run the command in.
                      If ``None``, the class tries to guess the appropriate
                      value based on the command.
        :param precise_mode: Normally, ``interval`` seconds are left between one
                             execution finishing and the next starting. Enabling
                             precise mode means that the class will try to time
                             it so there are ``interval`` seconds between the
                             start of each execution. If the command takes
                             longer than ``interval`` seconds to complete, then
                             this target obviously cannot be met; instead, the
                             command will be executed as often as possible.
        :param differences: Whether or not to highlight differences in the
                            output. Can be ``None``, for no highlighting,
                            ``'sequential'`` to show the differences between
                            sequential runs of the output, or ``'cumulative'``
                            to show all the characters that have changed at
                            least once since the first run.
        :param beep: Beep when the command results in a non-zero return code.
        :param errexit: Exit when the command results in a non-zero return code.
