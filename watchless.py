        This can either do so within the current process (``shell=False``) or
        using an external shell (``shell=True``). In general, ``shell=False`` is
        preferred except when the command contains special shell characters
        (e.g., the globbing character '*') which needs to be run in a shell to
        work properly. In this case, it usually has to be escaped when entering
        it and so the command passed in is a single-entry list.

        If the ``shell`` parameter is ``None``, the class will try to guess the
        appropriate setting using the following two steps:

            1. If the command list has more than one item, assume the command
               was not escaped when entered and therefore has no special
               characters; set ``shell`` to ``False``. Otherwise go to 2.
            2. If the single entry has any special characters (the list of which
               is defined in the module-level variable ``shell_chars``), then
               set ``shell`` to ``True``. Otherwise set it to ``False``.
